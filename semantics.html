        My name is Wilson Siaw. I am a Ghanaian man living in Bloemfontein, South Africa.
        I enjoy watching football a lot. The team I support is Manchester City Football
        Club. I also enjoy watching movies. My favourite types of movies to watch are science
        fiction, adventure, and comedy. In addition to these interest I enjoy learning how to
        build great web apps. I want to become the best possible software developer I can be.
        I like reading books as well. My favourite types of books to read are similar to the types
        of movies I watch. But in addition to these I like reading books on self development.
    </P>
